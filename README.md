 Liver Disease Prediction Model
This project focuses on predicting the presence of liver disease in patients using machine learning techniques. A dataset of medical records was used to train and evaluate multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Classifier.

📊 Dataset Overview
Total Samples: 583

Liver Disease Patients: 416

Non-Liver Disease Patients: 167

Gender Distribution: 441 males, 142 females

🚀 Summary
Among all the models trained, the Random Forest Classifier performed best based on accuracy and F1 Score. It showed strong predictive capability for distinguishing between patients with and without liver disease.
